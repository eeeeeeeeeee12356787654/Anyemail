Steps to Send Emails from Any Address:



1. Modify the Script for Custom "From" Address

   In the script, replace this line:

   email_message = f"From: {sender_email}\\nTo: {recipient_email}\\nSubject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}"



   With this:

   email_message = f"From: god@heaven.above\\nTo: {recipient_email}\\nSubject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}"



2. Set Up a Sending Email Account

   A. You'll still need a valid SMTP server and credentials (like a Gmail account).

   B. The email will appear to come from god@heaven.above, but technically, itâ€™s sent via the configured SMTP server.



3. Update the Sender Email in the Script

   Replace the actual sender email and password in the script with your valid SMTP credentials (e.g., Gmail account).



4. Run the Script

   Execute the script as before. The recipient will see god@heaven.above as the sender in their inbox.



Script Example:



import smtplib



def send_email(sender_email, recipient_email, subject, body, smtp_server, port, sender_password):

    # Set up the email headers

    email_message = f"From: god@heaven.above\\nTo: {recipient_email}\\nSubject: {subject}\\n\\n{body}"

    

    try:

        # Establish connection with the SMTP server

        with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, port) as server:

            server.starttls()  # Upgrade the connection to secure

            server.login(sender_email, sender_password)  # Log in to the SMTP server

            server.sendmail(sender_email, recipient_email, email_message)  # Send the email

            

        return "Email sent successfully!"

    

    except Exception as e:

        return f"Failed to send email: {str(e)}"



# Example usage:

# send_email(

#     sender_email="example_sender@gmail.com",

#     recipient_email="example_recipient@gmail.com",

#     subject="Test Email",

#     body="This is a test email.",

#     smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",

#     port=587,

#     sender_password="your_password"

# )



Additional Information:



Requirements for Running the Script on a Home Laptop Server:



1. Python Installed

   Ensure Python is installed on the laptop. You can download it from python.org.



2. Internet Connection

   The laptop must have an active internet connection to connect to the SMTP server and send emails.



3. Valid SMTP Server Credentials

   A. The script needs a valid email account for SMTP (like Gmail or Outlook).

   B. Enable "less secure apps" or create an app-specific password for your email provider.



4. Port Forwarding (Optional)

   If you're running the script as part of a web or mail server and expect external access, configure port forwarding on your router. For the script itself, this isn't necessary.



5. Firewall and Antivirus Permissions

   Some firewalls or antivirus software might block the connection to the SMTP server. Ensure the script and Python are allowed.



6. Power and Maintenance

   A laptop acting as a server should be powered on and connected to the internet whenever the script is in use.
